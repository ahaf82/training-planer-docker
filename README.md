Organize trainings with your mates

IÂ´m planning an app, which should help organizing trainings with your friends or other training partners.



### What the app should do:

There should be different roles: root user, admin, members and none.

The admins can create training groups. For each training group training sessions with description, date and time can be created by the admins.

Members should be able to register via e-mail address and password, later via Google or Facebook. First they have no role and no rights (none). They have to be set to member by an admin. Then they can be put into the created training groups.

When members are put into a training group they can subscribe to the sessions of the training-group. 

The training-session can be set to a maximum of members, who can subscribe by the admins.

The admin can see the training sessions of a training group and who subscribed to the respective training session in a list. 

There will be also a calendar as an overview for the admins with the training sessions.

You can register with your own data or use admin rights with:

E-Mail: admin@admin.com,
PW: adminUser_01



### The tools I use to create the app:

The Back-End will be set up with Express, Passport and MongoDB, the Front-End with ReactJS
