Organize trainings with your mates

IÂ´m planning an app, which should help help organizing trainings with your friends or other training partners.



### What the app should do:

There should be different roles: root user, admin, members and none.

The admins can create training groups. For each training group training sessions with description, date and time can be created by the admins.

Members should register local, via Facebook, Twitter or Google. First they have no role and no rights (none). They have to be put into training groups by an admin to get the role of a member. They can be in different groups.

When members are put to a training group they can subscribe to the sessions of the training-group. 

The training-session can be set to a maximum of members, who can subscribe by the admins.

The admin can see the training sessions of a training group and who subscribed to the respective training session in a list. 

There will be also a calendar as an overview for the admins and for the members with their respective training sessions.



### What are the tools I want to use to create the app:

The Back-End will be set up with Express, Passport and MongoDB, the Front-End with ReactJS
